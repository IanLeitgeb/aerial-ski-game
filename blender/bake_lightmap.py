WHAT IS ACTUALLY MISSING FROM THE RUNTIME
-----------------------------------------
The first version of this script baked COMBINED lighting and the second baked
indirect bounce. Both were wrong for this scene, and measuring said so:

  * COMBINED includes direct sunlight, which Babylon already renders in real
    time. Adding it counts every photon twice — the same mistake that washed the
    scene out when the map was first applied through the ambient slot.

  * INDIRECT-only came back 99.2% black. That is not a bug, it is geometry: this
    terrain is a handful of large flat slabs under an open sky. A point on a flat
    plane sees sky across almost its whole hemisphere and hardly any other
    surface, so there is nearly no bounce to capture. (The trees would bounce,
    except they are dark brown — they absorb.)

What the runtime genuinely gets wrong is different, and both errors are
MULTIPLICATIVE, which is what makes them safe to bake — a multiplier cannot
double-count light the way an additive term can:

  1. SKY VISIBILITY. The image-based ambient is applied at full strength
     everywhere, as though the entire sky dome were visible from every point.
     Snow tucked under a tree, inside the kicker's concave transition, or against
     a wall receives the same ambient as snow in the open. A path tracer computes
     the real fraction exactly.

  2. SUN SHADOW RESOLUTION. One 2048 shadow map is auto-fitted around every
     caster in the scene — 174 trees, the whole run, AND the distant background
     peaks — so it spans hundreds of metres and the terrain shadows come out
     mushy. Baked offline, the tree shadows on the snow are path-traced and soft
     in the right way, and the runtime map is then free to cover the athlete
     alone at a tight frustum.

OUTPUT
------
assets/terrain_skyvis.png   sky visibility, 1 = open sky   -> ambientTexture
assets/terrain_shadow.png   sun visibility, 1 = full sun   -> lightmapTexture
                                                              (as a shadowmap)
assets/terrain_uv2.json     per-mesh lightmap UVs, IN THE GAME'S VERTEX ORDER
assets/terrain_baked.glb    the same geometry, for eyeballing the bake offline

Both maps MULTIPLY an existing term, so the worst case if one is wrong is a
scene that is too dark or too flat — never one that is doubly lit.

ONLY THE SNOW RECEIVES
----------------------
Trees still CAST shadows and occlude sky — they are in the scene for the path
tracer — but they do not receive a map. There are ~174 of them against 28 snow
surfaces, so letting them into the atlas would spend most of the texels on
geometry nobody looks at and leave the landing hill with a patch a few pixels
across. Small dark objects keep real-time lighting; nobody can tell.

INPUT
-----
blender/terrain.json, extracted from the RUNNING game by
tests/drive/extract-terrain.spec.js — real world-space geometry and the actual
light rig values, so the bake matches what the player sees.

WHY A UV SIDECAR AND NOT THE GLB
--------------------------------
The game needs uv2 on the meshes it already has. Reading it back out of the glb
does not work: the glTF exporter splits a vertex wherever a UV seams, so the
exported vertex order no longer matches the game's and there is no way to map one
to the other after the fact. The sidecar is written directly from Blender in the
ORIGINAL vertex order, so the game applies it with a single setVerticesData and
keeps its meshes, materials, parents and physics untouched.

The script REFUSES to write a sidecar whose UVs are ambiguous (one vertex, two
different UVs across the faces that share it) rather than silently emitting a
mesh that would be lit wrongly. See check_uv_consistency.

    the SHADOW pass over the identical UVs filled the atlas. Baking AO removes the
    whole question: it traces rays into the hemisphere and returns the unoccluded
    fraction directly, with no lights, no world, no albedo and no pass
    classification to get wrong. It is already 0-1, so it must NOT be normalised.

    This is exactly the multiplier ambientTexture wants: the game applies its
    image-based ambient at full strength everywhere, as though the whole sky dome
    were visible from every point, and this is the fraction that actually is.
